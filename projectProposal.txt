Homework 7: Semester Project Proposal
By the deadline, please submit as a Word doc your response to each bulleted item below:

Your current answer to this question:  How do the Humanities and Data Analytics complement each other?
 What does each discipline provide the other that they lack on their own?  (You're encouraged to refine the ideas your first formulated in Threaded Discussion 1 or that you negotiate in your group).
Each on their own are usless, with Data you have numbers but no way to analyze them and humanities no concrete way to proove anything, the combination of the 2 is neccessary to do research. Especially with the rise of large data more and more patterns have been able to emirge leading to a better understanding of the human proccess.

Your broad topic or area of concern that will give you an opportunity to illustrate your answer to the question above
Patterns in how chat gpt responsponds and how potential biases can emerge from it

Your current (focused and manageable) Research Question that emerges from some current debate or concern related to your broad topic (you may need to draft several versions before you find your focus)
Given a verity of prompts asking chat GPT to explain varius human ideas in the fromat of "tell me about ______" and do patterns emerge and does this show any apperent biases in the Large Language Modles responses

Your initial Hypothesis (your current provisional answer to the Research Question that your project will test)
I believe it will show logical 
I believe it will become apperent that there is a vocabulary chatGPT perfers probably from a more logical or machiavellian standpoint

The dataset(s) you'll be working with (found or scraped)
We will get chatGPT responses using openAPI withen our code

The method(s) you'll use
Term frequency as well as using ChatGPT in order to topic model itself, I believe it will do a better and more strait forward job then topic modeling because they use the same technology in essence but 1 has significantly more training data and is more cutting age wwith its NLP coming from 2022 rather than 2012.

If working in a group, a description of the division of labor (who is responsible for what task?) 
Riley Durrer- Data recording and API usage
Adessa Faith- pandas and data proccessing
Andrew Potts- recording and structuring data in a visual way
